# SOLID Principals:
1. Single Responsibility Principle <<-- go focus on this one Tom.
> A class or module should have one, and only one, reason to be changed.
> Every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software, and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated by the class.
> Gather together the things that change for the same reasons. Separate those things that change for different reasons. - Robert Martin
- Separation of concern
- Level of cohesion between elements in the class
2. Open / Close Principle
3. Liskov Substitution Principle
4. Interface-Substitution Principle
5. Dependency Inversion Principle
